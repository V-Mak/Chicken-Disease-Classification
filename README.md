# Chicken-Disease-Classification

## Project Overview:
* Developed a system for chicken disease classification focusing on detecting Coccidiosis.
* Leveraged various data processing and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate classification.

## File Structure Overview:
* Utilized a structured file organization for clear separation of components and functionalities.

### Files Utilized:
* `.dvc and .dvcignore`: Version control for data files.
* `.gitignore`: Ignoring files for Git version control.
* `config and config.yaml`: Configuration files for model parameters and other settings.
* `.github/workflows`: GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD integration.
* `main.yaml`: YAML file, possibly for main configuration or pipeline setup.
* `research`: Directory likely containing research-related materials or documentation.

### Notebooks:
* 1_data_ingestion.ipynb: Notebook for data ingestion and preprocessing.
* 2_prepare_base_model.ipynb: Notebook for preparing the base model architecture.
* 3_prepare_callbacks.ipynb: Notebook for preparing callbacks for model training.
* 4_training.ipynb: Notebook for model training process.
* 5_model_evaluation.ipynb: Notebook for model evaluation and performance analysis.
* trials.ipynb: Notebook containing experimental or trial code.
* src/CDClassification: Source code directory for chicken disease classification.
* components: Directory for various components used in the project.
* data_ingestion.py, prepare_base_model.py, prepare_callbacks.py, training.py, evaluation.py: Python scripts/modules for specific stages of the classification pipeline.
* config: Configuration directory containing initialization and constants files.
* entity: Entity directory containing configuration entities.
* pipeline: Pipeline directory containing scripts/modules for different pipeline stages.
* utils: Utility functions directory.
* Other files like .dvcignore, Dockerfile, LICENSE, README.md, app.py, main.py, params.yaml, requirements.txt, scores.json, setup.py, template.py: Essential project files for documentation, deployment, and setup.

## Key Points for Resume:
* Developed an end-to-end chicken disease classification system, focusing on detecting Coccidiosis.
* Implemented a structured file organization and utilized version control with Git and DVC for efficient project management.
* Employed various data preprocessing techniques for data cleaning and ingestion.
* Designed and trained machine learning models using notebooks, focusing on base model preparation, training, and evaluation.
* Implemented a modular approach to code organization, separating components for data ingestion, model preparation, training, and evaluation.
* Utilized Python programming for implementing core functionalities and pipeline stages.
* Contributed to the project's documentation, including README, licensing, and setup files.
* Using Docker for containerization and managing dependencies.
* Used GitHub workflows for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
* Achieved accurate disease classification results as evidenced by evaluation metrics stored in scores.json.
